This folder aims at receiving the results of targetted assembly runs.

It contains also the results shown in the paper, in case one wants only to reproduce the figures or tables without running all the experiments:

* folder `count_paths/`contains intermediary statistics of MinYS for each run: counting enumerated paths before and after path comparisons. 
* folder `quast/` contains quast results for all targetted assembly runs (all tools). 
* folder `runtime/` contains runtime statistics for all targetted assembly runs (all tools).
